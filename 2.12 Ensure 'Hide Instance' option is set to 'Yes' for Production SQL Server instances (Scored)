Description:

    Non-clustered SQL Server instances within production environments should be designated
    as hidden to prevent advertisement by the SQL Server Browser service.

Rationale:

    Designating production SQL Server instances as hidden leads to a more secure installation
    because they cannot be enumerated. However, clustered instances may break if this option
    is selected.

Audit:
Perform either the GUI or T-SQL method shown:

GUI Method
      1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, expand SQL Server Network
      Configuration, right-click Protocols for <server instance>, and then select
      Properties.
      2. On the Flags tab, in the Hide Instance box, verify Yes is selected.

T-SQL Method
Execute the following T-SQL. A value of 1 should be returned.
        DECLARE @getValue INT;
        EXEC master..xp_instance_regread
        @rootkey = N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
        @key = N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL
        Server\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib',
        @value_name = N'HideInstance',
        @value = @getValue OUTPUT;
        SELECT @getValue;
        
Remediation:

Perform either the GUI or T-SQL method shown:
GUI Method
      1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, expand SQL Server Network
      Configuration, right-click Protocols for <server instance>, and then select
      Properties.
      2. On the Flags tab, in the Hide Instance box, select Yes, and then click OK to close the
      dialog box. The change takes effect immediately for new connections.
T-SQL Method
        Execute the following T-SQL to remediate:
        EXEC master..xp_instance_regwrite
        @rootkey = N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
        @key = N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL
        Server\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib',
        @value_name = N'HideInstance',
        @type = N'REG_DWORD',
        @value = 1;
Impact:
      This method only prevents the instance from being listed on the network. If the instance is
      hidden (not exposed by SQL Browser), then connections will need to specify the server and
      port in order to connect. It does not prevent users from connecting to server if they know
      the instance name and port.
      If you hide a clustered named instance, the cluster service may not be able to connect to the
      SQL Server. Please refer to the Microsoft documentation reference.
      Default Value:
      By default, SQL Server instances are not hidden.
      
      
      
Remarks
If you hide a named instance, you will need to provide the port number in the connection string to connect to the hidden instance, 
even if the browser service is running. We recommend that you use a static port instead of a dynamic port for the named hidden instance.
For more information, see Configure a Server to Listen on a Specific TCP Port (SQL Server Configuration Manager).

Clustering
If you hide a clustered named instance, cluster service may not be able to connect to SQL Server. This will cause the cluster 
instance's IsAlive check to fail and SQL Server will go offline. We recommend that you create an alias in all the nodes of the 
clustered instance to reflect the static port that you configured for the instance.
For more information, see Create or Delete a Server Alias for Use by a Client (SQL Server Configuration Manager).

If you hide a clustered named instance, cluster service may not be able to connect to SQL Server if the LastConnect registry key 
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client\SNI11.0\LastConnect) has a different port than the port that SQL Server 
is listening on. If the cluster service is unable to make a connection to the SQL Server, you might see an error similar to the 
following:
Event ID: 1001: Event Name: Failover clustering resource deadlock.
