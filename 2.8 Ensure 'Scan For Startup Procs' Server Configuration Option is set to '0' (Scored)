Description:

The scan for startup procs option, if enabled, causes SQL Server to scan for and
automatically run all stored procedures that are set to execute upon service startup.

Rationale:

Enforcing this control reduces the threat of an entity leveraging these facilities for
malicious purposes.

Audit:
Run the following T-SQL command:
      SELECT name,
      CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
      CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
      FROM sys.configurations
      WHERE name = 'scan for startup procs';
  Both value columns must show 0.

Remediation:
    Run the following T-SQL command:
        EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
        RECONFIGURE;
        EXECUTE sp_configure 'scan for startup procs', 0;
        RECONFIGURE;
        GO
        EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
        RECONFIGURE;
    
    Restart the Database Engine.

Impact:
Setting Scan for Startup Procedures to 0 will prevent certain audit traces and other
commonly used monitoring SPs from re-starting on start up. Additionally, replication
requires this setting to be enabled (1) and will automatically change this setting if needed.
