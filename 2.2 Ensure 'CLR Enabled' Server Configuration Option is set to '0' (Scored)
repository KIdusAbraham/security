--Description:
  --The clr enabled option specifies whether user assemblies can be run by SQL Server.

--Rationale:
  --Enabling use of CLR assemblies widens the attack surface of SQL Server and puts it at risk
  --from both inadvertent and malicious assemblies.
  
--Audit:
  --Run the following T-SQL command:
    SELECT name,
    CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
    CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
    FROM sys.configurations
    WHERE name = 'clr enabled';
      --Both value columns must show 0.

--Remediation:
  --Run the following T-SQL command:
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'clr enabled', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;   
      
--Impact:
    If CLR assemblies are in use, applications may need to be rearchitected to eliminate their
    usage before disabling this setting. Alternatively, some organizations may allow this setting
    to be enabled 1 for assemblies created with the SAFE permission set, but disallow
    assemblies created with the riskier UNSAFE and EXTERNAL_ACCESS permission sets. To find
    user-created assemblies, run the following query in all databases, replacing
    <database_name> with each database name:
        USE [<database_name>]
        GO
        SELECT name AS Assembly_Name, permission_set_desc
        FROM sys.assemblies
        WHERE is_user_defined = 1;
        GO
       -- Default Value:
       -- By default, this option is disabled (0).
