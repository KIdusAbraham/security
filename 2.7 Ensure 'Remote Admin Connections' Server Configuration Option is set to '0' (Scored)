Description:

The remote admin connections option controls whether a client application on a remote
computer can use the Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC).

Rationale:

The Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC) lets an administrator access a running
server to execute diagnostic functions or Transact-SQL statements, or to troubleshoot
problems on the server, even when the server is locked or running in an abnormal state
and not responding to a SQL Server Database Engine connection. In a cluster scenario, the
administrator may not actually be logged on to the same node that is currently hosting the
SQL Server instance and thus is considered "remote". Therefore, this setting should usually
be enabled (1) for SQL Server failover clusters; otherwise it should be disabled (0) which is
the default.

Audit:
Run the following T-SQL command:
Run the following T-SQL command:
      USE master;
      GO
      SELECT name,
      CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
      CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
      FROM sys.configurations
      WHERE name = 'remote admin connections'
      AND SERVERPROPERTY('IsClustered') = 0;
If no data is returned, the instance is a cluster and this recommendation is not applicable. If
data is returned, then both the value columns must show 0 to be compliant.

Remediation:
Run the following T-SQL command on non-clustered installations:
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'remote admin connections', 0;
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO
