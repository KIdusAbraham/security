Description:

The Database Mail XPs option controls the ability to generate and transmit email
messages from SQL Server.

Rationale:
Disabling Database Mail reduces the SQL Server surface, eliminates a DOS attack vector
and channel to exfiltrate data from the database server to a remote host.
Audit:

Audit:
Run the following T-SQL command:
        SELECT name,
        CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
        CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
        FROM sys.configurations
        WHERE name = 'Database Mail XPs';
    Both value columns must show 0.

Remediation:
Run the following T-SQL command:
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
      RECONFIGURE;
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'Database Mail XPs', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;
      GO
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;
