Description:

    The xp_cmdshell option controls whether the xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure can
    be used by an authenticated SQL Server user to execute operating-system command shell
    commands and return results as rows within the SQL client.

Rationale:
    The xp_cmdshell procedure is commonly used by attackers to read or write data to/from
    the underlying Operating System of a database server.

Audit:
Run the following T-SQL command:
      SELECT name,
      CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
      CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
      FROM sys.configurations
      WHERE name = 'xp_cmdshell';
Both value columns must show 0 to be compliant.

Remediation:
Run the following T-SQL command:
        EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
        RECONFIGURE;
        EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 0;
        RECONFIGURE;
        GO
        EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
        RECONFIGURE;
Default Value:
By default, this option is disabled (0).
