Description:
    The cross db ownership chaining option controls cross-database ownership chaining
    across all databases at the instance (or server) level.

Rationale:
    When enabled, this option allows a member of the db_owner role in a database to gain
    access to objects owned by a login in any other database, causing an unnecessary
    information disclosure. When required, cross-database ownership chaining should only be
    enabled for the specific databases requiring it instead of at the instance level for all
    databases by using the ALTER DATABASE <database_name> SET DB_CHAINING ON
    command. This database option may not be changed on the master, model, or tempdb
    system databases.

Audit:
Run the following T-SQL command:
    SELECT name,
    CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
    CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
    FROM sys.configurations
    WHERE name = 'cross db ownership chaining';
  Both value columns must show 0.

Remediation:
Run the following T-SQL command:
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'cross db ownership chaining', 0;
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO
Default Value:
By default, this option is disabled (0).


To determine the current status of cross-database ownership chaining, execute the following query:

    SELECT is_db_chaining_on, name FROM sys.databases;

A result of 1 indicates that cross-database ownership chaining is enabled.
Controlling Cross-Database Ownership Chaining
Before turning cross-database ownership chaining on or off, consider the following:

You must be a member of the sysadmin fixed server role to turn cross-database ownership chaining on or off.

Before turning off cross-database ownership chaining on a production server, fully test all applications, 
including third-party applications, to ensure that the changes do not affect application functionality.

You can change the cross db ownership chaining option while the server is running if you specify RECONFIGURE with sp_configure.

If you have databases that require cross-database ownership chaining, the recommended practice is to turn off the cross db 
ownership chaining option for the instance using sp_configure; then turn on cross-database ownership chaining for individual 
databases that require it using the ALTER DATABASE statement.

Ownership chaining across databases is turned off by default. Microsoft recommends that you disable cross-database 
ownership chaining because it exposes you to the following security risks:

        Database owners and members of the db_ddladmin or the db_owners database roles can create objects that are owned by other users. 
        These objects can potentially target objects in other databases. 
        This means that if you enable cross-database ownership chaining, you must fully trust these users with data in all databases.

        Users with CREATE DATABASE permission can create new databases and attach existing databases. 
        If cross-database ownership chaining is enabled, these users can access objects in other databases that t
        hey might not have privileges in from the newly created or attached databases that they create.
