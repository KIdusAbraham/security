Description:
    The cross db ownership chaining option controls cross-database ownership chaining
    across all databases at the instance (or server) level.

Rationale:
    When enabled, this option allows a member of the db_owner role in a database to gain
    access to objects owned by a login in any other database, causing an unnecessary
    information disclosure. When required, cross-database ownership chaining should only be
    enabled for the specific databases requiring it instead of at the instance level for all
    databases by using the ALTER DATABASE <database_name> SET DB_CHAINING ON
    command. This database option may not be changed on the master, model, or tempdb
    system databases.

Audit:
Run the following T-SQL command:
    SELECT name,
    CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
    CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
    FROM sys.configurations
    WHERE name = 'cross db ownership chaining';
  Both value columns must show 0.

Remediation:
Run the following T-SQL command:
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'cross db ownership chaining', 0;
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO
Default Value:
By default, this option is disabled (0).
