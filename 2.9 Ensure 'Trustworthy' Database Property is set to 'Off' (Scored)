Description:

    The TRUSTWORTHY database option allows database objects to access objects in other
    databases under certain circumstances.

Rationale:
    Provides protection from malicious CLR assemblies or extended procedures.

Audit:

    Run the following T-SQL query to list any databases with a Trustworthy database property value of ON:
        SELECT name
        FROM sys.databases
        WHERE is_trustworthy_on = 1
        AND name != 'msdb';
    No rows should be returned.

Remediation:

Execute the following T-SQL statement against the databases (replace <database_name> below) returned by the Audit Procedure:

      ALTER DATABASE [<database_name>] SET TRUSTWORTHY OFF;
Default Value:
  By default, this database property is OFF (is_trustworthy_on = 0), except for the msdb database in which it is required to be ON.
  
  
  
This property can be used to reduce certain threats that can exist as a result of attaching a database that contains one of the 
following objects:

    Malicious assemblies with an EXTERNAL_ACCESS or UNSAFE permission setting. For more information, see CLR Integration Security.

    Malicious modules that are defined to execute as high privileged users. For more information, see EXECUTE AS Clause (Transact-SQL).

Both of these situations require a specific degree of privileges and are protected against by appropriate mechanisms when they are used 
in the context of a database that is already attached to an instance of SQL Server. However, if the database is taken offline, 
a user that has access to the database file can potentially attach it to an instance of SQL Server of his or her choice and 
add malicious content to the database. When databases are detached and attached in SQL Server, certain permissions are set on the 
data and log files that restrict access to the database files.

Because a database that is attached to an instance of SQL Server cannot be immediately trusted, the database is not allowed to access 
resources beyond the scope of the database until the database is explicitly marked trustworthy. Therefore, if you backup or detach a 
database that has the TRUSTWORTHY option ON and you attach or restore the database to the same or another SQL Server instance, 
the TRUSTWORTHY property will be set to OFF upon attach/restore completion. Also, modules that are designed to access resources 
outside the database, and assemblies with either 
the EXTERNAL_ACCESS and UNSAFE permission setting, have additional requirements in order to run successfully.
