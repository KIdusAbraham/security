Description:

    The remote access option controls the execution of local stored procedures on remote
    servers or remote stored procedures on local server.

Rationale:

    Functionality can be abused to launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on remote servers
    by off-loading query processing to a target.

Audit:

Run the following T-SQL command:
        SELECT name,
        CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
        CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
        FROM sys.configurations
        WHERE name = 'remote access';
        Both value columns must show 0.
Remediation:

      Run the following T-SQL command:
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
      RECONFIGURE;
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'remote access', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;
      GO
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;
      Restart the Database Engine.
      
 
 This topic describes how to configure the remote access server configuration option in SQL Server 2017 
 by using SQL Server Management Studio or Transact-SQL. The remote access option controls the execution 
 of stored procedures from local or remote servers on which instances of SQL Server are running. 
 This default value for this option is 1. This grants permission to run local stored procedures 
 from remote servers or remote stored procedures from the local server. To prevent local stored procedures 
 from being run from a remote server or remote stored procedures from being run on the local server, set the option to 0.
