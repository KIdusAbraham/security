--Description:
  --Enabling Ad Hoc Distributed Queries allows users to query data and execute statements onexternal data sources. 
  --This functionality should be disabled.

--Rationale:
  --This feature can be used to remotely access and exploit vulnerabilities on remote SQL Server instances 
  --and to run unsafe Visual Basic for Application functions.
  
--Audit:
--un the following T-SQL command:
    SELECT name,
    CAST(value as int) as value_configured,
    CAST(value_in_use as int) as value_in_use
    FROM sys.configurations
    WHERE name = 'Ad Hoc Distributed Queries';
    --Both value columns must show 0.

--Remediation:
    --Run the following T-SQL command:
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
      RECONFIGURE;
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'Ad Hoc Distributed Queries', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;
      GO
      EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
      RECONFIGURE;


By default, SQL Server does not allow ad hoc distributed queries using OPENROWSET and OPENDATASOURCE. 
When this option is set to 1, SQL Server allows ad hoc access. When this option is not set or is set to 0, 
SQL Server does not allow ad hoc access.

Ad hoc distributed queries use the OPENROWSET and OPENDATASOURCE functions to connect to remote data sources that use OLE DB. OPENROWSET and OPENDATASOURCE should be used only to reference OLE DB data sources that are accessed infrequently. 
For any data sources that will be accessed more than several times, define a linked server.
 
Remarks
    Attempting to make an ad hoc connection with Ad Hoc Distributed Queries not enabled results in 
    error: Msg 7415, Level 16, State 1, Line 1

    Ad hoc access to OLE DB provider 'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0' has been denied. You must access this provider 
    through a linked server.

Examples
   The following example enables ad hoc distributed queries and then queries a server named Seattle1 using the OPENROWSET function.

    sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO 
    sp_configure 'Ad Hoc Distributed Queries', 1;  
    RECONFIGURE;  
    GO  
          SELECT a.*  
          FROM OPENROWSET('SQLNCLI', 'Server=Seattle1;Trusted_Connection=yes;',  
               'SELECT GroupName, Name, DepartmentID  
                FROM AdventureWorks2012.HumanResources.Department  
                ORDER BY GroupName, Name') AS a;  
          GO
